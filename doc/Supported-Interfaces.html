  <div class="section">Electrical Interface Types</div>

  <p>There are various common hardware interfaces used for diagnostic
  interfaces to vehicle electronic control units (ecus). Most manufacturers use
  one or two such interfaces for all systems on a vehicle. These include:

  <p><ul>
    <li>ISO9141
    <li>ISO14230
    <li>SAEJ1850-VPW
    <li>SAEJ1850-PWM
    <li>CAN
  </ul>

  <p>ISO9141 and ISO14230 are essentially compatible at an electrical level
  (with the exception that the latter will work on 24 volt vehicles).

  <p>The freediag protocol stack supports the above list with the exception of
  the CAN. The US OBDII standard and the European EOBD standard for
  communicating with emissions related ECUs do not mandate CAN support.
  
  <p>The ISO protocols are generally used by European Vehicles, and the two
  SAEJ1850 types by Ford and GM.
  
  <p>At a software level, ISO14230 is a vastly extended ISO9141-2 protocol that
  supports much longer data frames and much quicker communications startup with
  the ECU.
  
  <p>Further information can be obtained from:

  <div class="section">About Smart/Dumb classification</div>
  <p>There are two general types of interfaces, referred to as "active" / "smart"
  (with an onboard microcontroller) and "passive" / "dumb" (no mcu, only signal
  level translation and possibly opto-isolation).<br>
<ul><li>
"Active" IFCs are very friendly for the programmers, because
they take care of all the car protocol timing issues, and turn the
very strange and demanding signals into a simple PC serial port flow
of characters. This is like using the "AT"modem commands, so you can
see how easy it is. So timing is not critical and can be left to the
interface HW, and logical results are garanteed at the SW level. However,
the protocol is interface-proprietary.<br>
It may also set limits on what freediag can do outside of what the interface supports,
such as custom protocols over standard layers etc.<br>
<li>
"Passive" IFCs have very little electronics on them, because they
only try to protect the PC serial port and adapt the voltage levels (sometimes with
optical isolation) . This means that the PC is dealing directly with the
car's ECU signals, and therefore the timing must be VERY precise. But
these IFCs have one advantage: they are open-source-friendly and low-level enough
to allow any protocol to be used. In some cases they can also be faster than "smart" interfaces.<br>
</ul>
  <br>

  <div class="section">Freediag Supported Interfaces</div>

  <p>Freediag contains various drivers for different adapters that connect the
  PC serial port to a vehicle. Certain interfaces support more protocol types
  than have been implemented/tested within a driver, and some interfaces need
  to be ordered with special attributes (such as their address) to work without
  recompiling the freediag software library.

  <p><ol>
    <li>Generic dumb serial adaptors<br><br>
    Freediag Driver: DUMB (diag_l0_dumb.c)<br>
    *** read <a href="dumb_interfaces.txt">doc/dumb_interfaces.txt !!!</a> ***<br>
    <br>
    These are generic serial to K-line interfaces, typically very simple circuits *without* an onboard microcontroller.<br>
    VAG409 / KKL409 interfaces fall in this category. Other examples include:<br>
    Andy Whittaker's OBD-II ISO9141 interface;<br>
    <a href="http://www.andywhittaker.com/ecu/obdii_hardware.htm">(website down)</a><br><br>
    Silicon Engines ISO 9141 interface:<br>
    <a href="http://www.siliconengines-ltd.com/products/9141-232.html">(website down)</a><br>
        It is supplied in a robust box with lots of lights. This interface was used to
    develop the first bits of the freediag project. It is functionally the same
    as the above two interfaces (with the exception of all the lights and the
    box).<br><br>

        Jeff's OBD-II ISO 9141 interface:<br>

This site shows you how to build a generic serial to ISO9141 interface.<br>

    <li>B.Roadman ISO9141/VPW/PWM interface:<br>
    <a href="http://www.obddiagnostics.com/">(website down) </a><br>
    Freediag Driver: BR1 (diag_l0_br.c)<br>
    <br>
    Another commercially available interface, we haven't yet tested the ISO9141
    side of the interface (supports address 0x33 only), and it does not support ISO14230. Future versions
    will support ISO14230 and we used this interface to develop the
    J1850-VPW/PWM support in Freediag. Thanks to B. Roadman for the donation of
    hardware to the project.<br>
    These qualify as "smart" interfaces.<br>

    <li>Multiplex Engineering VPW, PWM, and ISO 9141-2 interface:<br>
    <a href="http://multiplex-engineering.com/obd2-interfaces/">http://multiplex-engineering.com/obd2-interfaces/</a><br>
    Freediag Driver: MET16 (diag_l0_me.c)<br>
    <br>
    When ordering this interface you must order a T16 type interface.
    Multiplex Engineering produce two varieties of the T16 interface:<br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>T16-002: opto-isolated interface that requires power from the PC's
          serial port and uses a straight through male-female DB9 cable.
      
      <li>T16-003: Non-opto isolated interface, uses a null-modem female-female
          DB9 cable, doesn't require (much) power from the PC.
    </ul>
    <br>
    Many PC's do not provide enough power to drive the T16-002 interface and
    thus errors will occur (and "checksum error" messages will be printed by
    the freediag software). As the T16-003 has no opto-isolation there is a
    slight risk of damage to the PC. According to the manufacturer the risk is
    low and is negligible unless the vehicle is connected to a battery
    charger.<br>
    <br>
    When ordering an interface an interface that operates at 19200 baud and
    uses address 0x38 should be specified, or simple modifications to
    <i>diag_l0_me.c</i> and recompilation will be needed.<br>
    <br>
    The T16-002 interface was used to develop support for smart interfaces in
    freediag, it worked on a modern Sony Laptop but not on various branded PCs
    tested.<br>

    <a href="http://elmelectronics.com/obdic.html">http://elmelectronics.com/obdic.html</a><br>
    Freediag Driver: ELM (diag_l0_elm.c)<br>
    <br>
    The ELM32x ICs are smart protocol translators that are frequently found in recent USB->OBD cables. Freediag partially
    supports these devices. Be aware that many so-called ELM32x adapters use a cloned but not completely compatible
    IC. Most cheap devices sold on eBay / Amazon will be clones.<br>
    These qualify as "smart" interfaces.<br>
    Availabilty: IC by itself direct from vendor, or assembled interfaces from various third parties<br>

    <br>
    <li>CARSIM interface:<br>
    Freediag driver: CARSIM (diag_l0_sim.c)<br>
    <br>
    The CARSIM interface allows testing of higher levels (L2, L3) without
   having an actual car connected. It reads requests and responses from a file.<br><br>

This was coded by vnevoa ~2004. From his presentation: <br>
Basically, it is a file reader and parser that searches for the byte
sequence that is being sent to the car, and if it finds any number of
answers for it, it simulates the responses from the car. I included a
simple parsing mechanism to simulate whatever test values we want by
placing a few text tokens inside the response sequences, which get
translated into byte values through specific functions.<br>
